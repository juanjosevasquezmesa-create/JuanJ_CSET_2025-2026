"inline-block" display style allows elements to be side by side but also allow it to have the padding that inline tags do not have.
"line break" is the term used to describe the action of moving an element below another 

inline-block acts like a block but doesnt take the whole width and allows other inline tags to be beside it

Left align -> float: left;
center align -> margin: 0 auto;
right align -> float: right;
