● Turn out that there is a midway between block elements and inline
elements. That is the inline block element.

● Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-
block allows to set a width and height on the element.

● Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are
respected, but with display: inline they are not.

● Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-
block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can
sit next to other elements.
